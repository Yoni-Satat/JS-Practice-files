		// to use a variable with a string of text we must put thae var name and add the +sign before the string and/or after the string:
		
		var name = 'yoni';
		var age = 43;
		document.write(name + " is my name and my age is " + age)

		// another way it can be done is if the variable is made of string and I have more than 1 variable:

		var tuna = "I am a fish ";
		var bacon = "I am a pig ";
		var cow = "and I am just a cow";
		document.write(tuna+bacon+cow); // this will print: I am a fish I am a pig and I am just a cow
